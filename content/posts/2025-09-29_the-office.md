For the last two and half weeks I've been working from the Czech Republic. My usually place of work is my home office in Wales. While my partner's mum does have a home office, it lacks the things I require to get my work done; a stable internet connection.

This created a problem for me that the 21st century has solved; co-working spaces. The issue now is that I haven't worked in an office since March 2023. Sure, I've been to an office since then but I haven't worked, day in day out from an office in a long time. 

Here are something reflections on my time working from an office:

* **I'm not more productive at home or in the office**

For the last few years I would tell you that I'm more productive at home than in an office. I've found this to be false. I'm able to produce as much (or as little on off days) as I would at home. I'm able to find flow just as easy (noise cancleing headphones, am i right) wherever. 

Caveat: I don't speak a lot of Czech so there wasn't a lot of room for conversation to happen and take me out of the flow. Maybe I would feel different in an office who's main language is my main language

* **The commute was okay**

Not all commutes are made equal and mine was probably one of the better ones; a 15 minute cycle either way albeit over a hill. It highlighted that I may have neglected my health for a little bit. The first week of daily cycles was a bit of a killer. However, extra context so I don't feel so bad; I have an 8 month old baby and his sleep was terrible over these two weeks. So it could be that, it could be that I haven't had a consistent work out in 8 months.. you decied. 

* **Being away from my family was tough**

I'll start with the silver lining; he was stoked when I would return home. He gave me such big smiles and that warmed my heart. But I missed him every day. And I think this is the curx of on-site working for me; it takes me away from my family and I don't like that. Right now, my family is at the top of my list. Sure providing for my family is tied to that but I love them to much to leave them for a third of the day and over 20% of my week. 

Key learnings from this week; get back into the gym, cherish pressure moments with your family and be greatful for remote working.
