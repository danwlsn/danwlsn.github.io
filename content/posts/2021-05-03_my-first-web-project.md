I was shocked to realise that I've been writing code for 10 years now. I remember the first web project I took on. My college class was set out to create a website for a client. By client they meant some local business that needed a brochure website. I had other ideas so I went straight to my film maker friend Lewis Hancock. One of the requirements was to get paid for your work. Lewis, being a film maker, had no money. And me, being a good friend, wanted to make it fair. The deal was set; one website for one copy of Halo 3: ODST. The worst Halo game ever.

Building this website set me on a path of wanting to master the web. Going on to study web application development at university, graduting and getting a job building web sites for a local advertising agency. Looking back at my time there I came to the conclusion that the best thing I built there was a coffee cam that alerted slack where there was fresh coffe. It became clear that I wanted to build more than just brochures. I took some time off work to travel and worked on my skills for building bigger applications. Landing back in the UK I was then given the opportunity to build such applicatoins for money.

But I find myself here again, working with Lewis on a new adventure into the metaverse. The first crypto related project I built; The Cabbage Patch (don't open on mobile, RIP your data) A collection of artwork by a small community of optimist. Built using NFT Glitch (Made by an optimist Iain Nash) and published to IPFS. The last few months have been a whirlwind tour of crypto, something I've been interested in for a long time but only recently learnt the full potential of. I'm excited to get working on some projects and master the web 3.0.
