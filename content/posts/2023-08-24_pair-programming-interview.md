I've done many pair programming interviews. Some good, most not so good. I'd like to discuss how, if you are going to conduct this type of interview, you can make it a fair test.

## Offer multiple ways to run the exercise
Offer the participant options on how to run the exercise. Whether that's locally or on some sort of online environment. And test the requirements for doing each one so you're ready. I've been asked to complete this exercise through screen sharing controls on someone elses machine. The interview went about as well as you can imagine.

## Be upfront about what you're looking for
What are you looking for in this exercise? Are you looking out for how they work collabortivly, are you looking at how they approach problems? Let the participant know up front what it is you are trying to guage from this and do not deviate from it in the judgement. 

## Do not use a mock domain problem from your industry
Sometimes the story runs "We want to give you an example you would actualy work on". And then you have this half baked mock problem that's quite far of what the real situation would be like but with some domain language sprinkled across there. Avoid it. Use neautral ground software problems. It allows you to change up the problem for each interview.

## Do a take home tech test
My top reccomendation for this problem is to avoid it. Ask the participant to code something in their own time as you will get a more accurate representation of their skills. They will produce a solution that they are comfortable with not something that they rushed together under the pressure of watchful eyes. You can ask them to present back their work and discuss the code in depth later. But pair programming exercises with strangers are not accurtate representations of work.
