- I'm starting to use linux to leave Apple

- I've been here before with PopOS and Nix
- Nix wasn't good but everyone talks about the packages

- I've been leaning into Packagament on macos and it's great


I've recently installed Arch on an old Thinkpad in a first step to leaving Apple behind. And I've made this step many times before. 

The first time I did this was after leaving a job, handing my work Macbook back and not having a current Macbook. I had limited income and decdided that I would daily drive a cheap Thinkpad. I didn't want to run windows so I installed PopOS. I ran this setup for about a year before going back to work and earning enough to pick up a new Macbook.

Then everyone moved to Mastadon and I heard about Nix. I was daily driving my Macbook so I thought I would try out NixOS on the Thinkpad. It "worked" and I was able to mirror my setup on MacOS with that darwin home manager nix thing. I forget what it's called. Then the issues came in. Mainly, rebuilding every time you want to make a change and rebuilding so many times when you make mistakes. 

NixOS is touted for three reasons:
- One config everywhere
- All the packages
- Immutable builds

But immutable builds? One config everywhere? Aren't these important? Aren't these useful? Useful, yes. Important, no. Neccessary? Absolutly not. 

My dotfiles repo is my old and most active repo. While the history isn't there it's over 10 years old. It's been through sublime text, Vim, Emacs, Neovim, Doom Emacs, back to Neovim. It's my ride or die. And over the years I've learn how easy it is to set up a new machine. Without immutability. It's not neccessary for me.
