I've had a blog or personal site for as long as I have been programming now. However it has never lasted. And in multiple aspects. The habit of writing posts and publishing them hasn't lasted and the neither did the site. It's changed domains, URLs, hosting providers, you name it. 
<!-- more -->

I beleive that somewhere on my harddrives I have copies of those posts but they are not accessible online anywhere. And that's going to change. I came across this concept of web things being [designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/). It made me feel bad for the webpages that I have built that are no longer on the internet. And with whatever is going on with Xwitter at the moment, I'm starting to take my online presense seriously.

So now, this site will be built to last. Currently all that has mean is reducing the complexity of build process. I hear people going back to straight HTML for this step but I need seperation of files and clean writing experience to get writing done. So I've gone from a headless CMS driven site back to static generation from markdown files. Ahhh, simpler times. 

I have ideas for comparing the `sitemap.xml` at build time with the live one and not being able to publish unless all of the live links are still going to be live. But I'll save that for another day.
