* **Reading**
    * Since coming back from the Czech Republic and continuing with house renovations I haven't had the time for reading
    * I would like to get back to [Let My People Go Surfing][1]

* **Working**
    * Exploring Claude Code and how it can work for me
    * So far, it's proved useful
    * However, I still have the same cycle with AI; going from "this thing is great" to "this thing sucks" very quickly
    * For side projects I've really enjoyed the reduced mental load that it offers which has lead to me working on them in the evening

* **Life**
    * Coming into Autumn in the UK means it's surfing season
